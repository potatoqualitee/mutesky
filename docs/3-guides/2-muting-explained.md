# Understanding MuteSky's Muting System

## The Basics: How Muting Works

Think of MuteSky's muting system like a smart content filter for your Bluesky feed. It's designed to work alongside any muting you've already set up, not replace it.

## Your Keywords Are Safe

One of the most important things to understand is that MuteSky is very careful with your existing muted keywords:

1. **We Never Delete Your Keywords**
   - If you've muted "cats" outside of MuteSky, we'll never remove it
   - Think of it like having a personal list that we promise never to erase
   - We only manage the keywords from our curated list

2. **Case Doesn't Matter**
   - Whether you muted "Bitcoin", "bitcoin", or "BITCOIN", we handle it
   - It's like having a smart assistant who understands these are the same thing
   - We preserve the original case when displaying keywords

## How It All Works Together

### When You First Log In

1. **We Check Your Existing Mutes**
   - MuteSky looks at what you've already muted on Bluesky
   - Like taking inventory of your current setup
   - We note these down to make sure we don't mess with them

2. **We Show What's Already Muted**
   - Keywords from our list that you've already muted show up as checked
   - Your custom keywords stay in the background, safely preserved
   - It's like having two lists: our suggestions and your personal choices

### When You Make Changes

1. **Adding New Mutes**
   - Select keywords from our list
   - Click the mute button
   - We add these to your Bluesky mutes without touching your existing ones

2. **Removing Mutes**
   - You can only unmute keywords from our list
   - Your personal muted keywords stay untouched
   - It's like having a guest who can only move their own things

## Muting Settings

You have control over how muting works:

1. **Scope Options**
   - "All Content": Mutes keywords in posts and tags
   - "Tags Only": Only mutes hashtags
   - Like choosing whether to filter just headlines or entire articles

2. **Duration**
   - Choose how long mutes should last
   - Set them to expire after a certain time
   - Or keep them permanent

3. **Following Exception**
   - Option to not mute content from people you follow
   - Like saying "I trust these sources, show me their content anyway"

## Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: Mixed Keywords
```
Your existing mutes: "bitcoin", "kitty", "ELON"
Our list includes: "Bitcoin", "DeSantis", "Pence"

What you'll see:
✓ Bitcoin (checkmark, can unmute - matches your "bitcoin")
□ DeSantis (no checkmark, can mute)
□ Pence (no checkmark, can mute)
("kitty" and "ELON" are preserved but not shown)
```

### Scenario 2: Making Changes
```
You mute "DeSantis" through MuteSky:
- "DeSantis" gets added to your Bluesky mutes
- Your original mutes ("bitcoin", "kitty", "ELON") stay exactly as they are
- The checkbox for "DeSantis" shows as checked
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with a few keywords
   - See how they affect your feed
   - Add more as needed

2. **Use the Preview**
   - The mute button shows exactly what will change
   - "Mute 5 new" means adding 5 new keywords
   - "Unmute 3 existing" means removing 3 from our list

3. **Check Your Settings**
   - Review your muting settings periodically
   - Adjust scope and duration as needed
   - Consider the following exception for trusted sources

## Common Questions

### "What happens to my existing mutes?"
They stay exactly as they are. MuteSky never removes mutes you've set up outside our system.

### "Can I unmute everything?"
You can unmute any keywords from our list, but your personal muted keywords will stay muted.

### "Why do some keywords show as already muted?"
These are keywords from our list that match ones you've already muted on Bluesky (regardless of case).

### "What's the difference between muting all content vs tags only?"
- All content: Filters the keyword everywhere (posts and tags)
- Tags only: Only filters when the keyword is used as a hashtag

Remember: MuteSky is designed to enhance your Bluesky experience, not take control of it. Your preferences always come first, and we're just here to help make content filtering easier.
