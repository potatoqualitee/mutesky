# Understanding MuteSky's Modes

## The Big Picture

MuteSky has two ways of working - Simple Mode and Advanced Mode. Think of it like having both an automatic and manual transmission in your car. Simple Mode is like automatic - it handles a lot of the complexity for you. Advanced Mode is like manual - you get complete control over everything.

## Simple Mode: The Easy Way

Imagine you're organizing your closet. Instead of dealing with individual pieces of clothing, you might say "I want to organize my work clothes" or "I want to sort my gym wear". This is how Simple Mode works:

1. **Contexts Instead of Keywords**
   - Rather than managing individual keywords, you select broader contexts like "Political Content" or "Sports Drama"
   - Each context automatically handles related keywords for you
   - It's like having a professional organizer who knows what goes where

2. **Filter Levels**
   - Level 0 (Minimal): Just the essentials, like having a basic wardrobe
   - Level 1 (Moderate): A balanced approach
   - Level 2 (Extensive): More comprehensive filtering
   - Level 3 (Complete): Maximum filtering, like organizing everything down to the last sock

3. **Smart Exceptions**
   - Want to keep track of your favorite team but filter other sports? Use exceptions
   - It's like saying "I want to organize all my clothes, but leave my favorite jacket where it is"

## Advanced Mode: Complete Control

Advanced Mode is for when you want to manage everything yourself. It's like deciding exactly where each piece of clothing goes in your closet:

1. **Direct Keyword Management**
   - See every keyword available
   - Choose exactly what to mute or unmute
   - Perfect for fine-tuning your filters

2. **Category Organization**
   - Keywords are grouped into categories
   - Easy to find related terms
   - Toggle entire categories at once

## How They Work Together

Here's the clever part - these modes work together seamlessly:

1. **Advanced Mode is the Boss**
   - Any changes you make in Advanced Mode stick
   - Simple Mode respects these changes
   - It's like having your manual organization take priority over the automatic system

2. **Simple Mode is Smart**
   - Derives its actions from Advanced Mode's state
   - Updates automatically when Advanced Mode changes
   - Maintains a user-friendly interface while respecting your detailed preferences

## Real-World Example

Let's say you're managing political content:

1. **In Simple Mode:**
   - Select the "Political Content" context
   - Choose a filter level
   - Maybe add an exception for your favorite topic
   - The system handles all the keywords automatically

2. **In Advanced Mode:**
   - See all political keywords
   - Choose specific terms to mute
   - Fine-tune exactly what you want to see or hide
   - Your choices are remembered and respected by Simple Mode

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use Simple Mode When:
- You want quick, easy content management
- You prefer broader categories over specific terms
- You're just getting started with content filtering
- You want a "set it and forget it" approach

### Use Advanced Mode When:
- You need precise control
- You want to see exactly what's being filtered
- You have specific terms you want to manage
- You're comfortable with more detailed configuration

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with Simple Mode to get a feel for the system
   - Use filter levels to find your comfort zone
   - Add exceptions as needed

2. **Graduate to Advanced**
   - Switch to Advanced Mode when you want more control
   - Your Simple Mode settings are preserved
   - Make fine-tuned adjustments without losing your base configuration

3. **Mix and Match**
   - Use Simple Mode for broad categories
   - Switch to Advanced for specific adjustments
   - The system maintains consistency between both

Remember: There's no "right" way to use MuteSky. Choose the mode that works best for you, and feel free to switch between them as your needs change.
