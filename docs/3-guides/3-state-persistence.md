# Understanding How MuteSky Saves Your Changes

## The Big Picture

MuteSky is designed to let you experiment freely with different settings and keywords before committing your changes. Think of it like online shopping - you can add items to your cart (make changes), but nothing is final until you click "checkout" (click the mute/unmute button).

## When Changes Are Saved

### The Golden Rule: Mute Button is King
The most important thing to understand is that changes are only saved when you click the mute/unmute button. This is intentional and here's why:

1. **Freedom to Experiment**
   - Try different filter levels
   - Toggle contexts on and off
   - Check and uncheck keywords
   - Nothing is permanent until you're ready

2. **Preview Your Changes**
   - The mute button shows exactly what will happen
   - "Mute 5 new" means adding 5 new keywords
   - "Unmute 3 existing" means removing 3 keywords
   - You can see the impact before committing

## What Gets Saved

When you do click the mute/unmute button, here's what's saved:

1. **Active Keywords**
   - Which keywords are checked/unchecked
   - Your manually unchecked preferences
   - Context selections in Simple mode

2. **Mode Settings**
   - Whether you're in Simple or Advanced mode
   - Your selected filter level
   - Which contexts are selected
   - Any exceptions you've set

3. **User Preferences**
   - Target keyword count
   - Last bulk action (enable/disable all)
   - Interface settings

## Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: Experimenting with Filters
```
1. You're in Simple mode
2. Change filter level from 0 to 2
3. UI updates immediately
4. BUT changes aren't saved yet
5. Click mute button to make it permanent
```

### Scenario 2: Context Changes
```
1. Select "Political Content" context
2. UI shows new keywords to be muted
3. Add an exception for a specific category
4. Nothing is muted yet
5. Click mute button to apply changes
```

### Scenario 3: Logging Back In
```
1. Last session: clicked mute button after setting filter level 2
2. Log out, then log back in
3. Filter level 2 is restored
4. All your selections are exactly as you left them
```

## What's Not Automatically Saved

1. **Filter Level Changes**
   - Changing levels updates the UI
   - But doesn't save until mute/unmute

2. **Context Toggles**
   - Selecting/deselecting contexts
   - Adding/removing exceptions
   - All temporary until mute/unmute

3. **Keyword Toggles**
   - Checking/unchecking keywords
   - Enable/disable all actions
   - Need mute/unmute to persist

## Why This Design?

1. **Safety First**
   - No accidental mass changes
   - Clear preview of what will happen
   - Easy to experiment without fear

2. **Clear Intent**
   - Clicking mute/unmute shows clear intention
   - No surprise changes to your Bluesky mutes
   - You're always in control

3. **Better Experience**
   - Free to try different combinations
   - See the effects before committing
   - Easy to back out of changes

## Pro Tips

1. **Experiment Freely**
   - Try different filter levels
   - Toggle contexts on and off
   - The mute button will show the outcome

2. **Watch the Mute Button**
   - It's your guide to what will change
   - Shows exactly what will be muted/unmuted
   - Clear indication of pending changes

3. **Understanding Persistence**
   - Changes aren't lost on mode switch
   - But they're not saved until mute/unmute
   - Your last saved state is restored on login

## Common Questions

### "Why didn't my filter level save?"
You need to click the mute/unmute button after changing the filter level. This lets you preview the effect before committing.

### "Will I lose my changes if I switch modes?"
No! Changes stay in memory until you either:
- Click mute/unmute to save them
- Log out without saving
- Refresh the page without saving

### "What happens if I log out without saving?"
You'll return to your last saved state - the last time you clicked mute/unmute.

### "Do I need to save after every small change?"
No! Make all your changes, then save once with mute/unmute when you're happy with everything.

Remember: The mute/unmute button is your "save" button. Feel free to experiment - nothing is permanent until you click it!
